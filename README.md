# OpenCraft

OpenCraft is an open source implementation of the popular game InfiniteCraft. 


## Setup

Download the `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q8_0.gguf` into the server/models folder. You can downloa it [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/tree/main).

Please make sure to run both the frontend and the backend servers, otherwise OpenCraft will not work.

## Run the Frontend

### Run with npm

To start the Vite Dev Server you can run 

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Run with Docker 

There is also a docker-compose.yml (frontend-only for now, because of performance reasons) which you can start with, it is configured to connect to a Traefik Reverse-Proxy: 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Run the Backend

You can start the API/Backend Server by running

```bash
cd server
npm run start
```
